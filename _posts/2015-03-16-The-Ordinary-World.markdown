The book I recommended today named The Ordinary World. It was a river novel written by a famous Chinese writer, Lu Yao. Actually, my Chinese teacher recommended me to read this book many years ago, when I was a high school freshman. Many years past and the story have been adapted for a television series, but I still never read that book.

Since that I’m pretty interested with this TV series. So I try to catch up. It attracted me since the first scene. After few days, I regret it. I regret that I didn’t read that book when I was 16 years old. And the hero, Sun Shaoping is a high school student just like my age when I heard this book. I didn’t read the book but I watch TV show, it described how ordinary people struggled for a better life in the 1970s to 1980s.

For that time, a passage from A Tale of two Cities came to me, I don’t it’s appropriate or not:

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way.
