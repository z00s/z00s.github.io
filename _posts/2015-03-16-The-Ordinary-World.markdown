The book I recommended today named The Ordinary World. It was a river novel written by a famous Chinese writer, Lu Yao. Actually, my Chinese teacher recommended me to read this book many years ago, when I was a high school freshman. She just told us it’s a good book. It’s worth to read it. You know, at that age, you didn’t like to hear advice from other people, especially a teacher. Therefore, many years past and the story have been adapted for a television series, but I still hadn’t read that book, even a word. 
    
Since my Chinese teacher’s recommended, I’m pretty interested with this TV series. And it attracted me since the first scene. After few days, I regret it. I regret that I didn’t read that book when I was 16 years old, the same age as the hero, Sun Shaoping. Sun Shaoping is a high school student in the beginning of the book. His family condition is pretty bad. And his elder brother is holding the whole family. For that reason, they give up lots of things they really love. But they never give up the hope to live a better life.  The whole novel described how these ordinary people struggled for a better life in the 1970s to 1980s. 
    
I think it’s a good TV product. But when I do some research about this book on the internet. A lot of netizens think that this TV series is not excellent enough compared to the original novel. As the writer Lu Yao was a native in northwest country, and he experienced ‘The Cultural Revolution’ and China’s ‘reform and opening up’, he had a kind of unique understanding of the country life and the special relationship among the peasants. You can read that between the lines. He had ever been a temporary teacher, which was similar to the character in his book. Elderly people think that we young people cannot understand what happened in that time. You can feel these thing’s influence on one generation. So I’m reading the original novel, and recommend it to all of you.
    
To describe that time, I quote a passage from A Tale of two Cities, I can’t recite it, here it is:
    


>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way.

------
>那是最美好的时代,那是最糟糕的时代;那是智慧的年头,那是愚昧的年头;那是信仰的时期,那是怀疑的时期;那是光明的季节,那是黑暗的季节;那是希望的春天,那是失望的冬天;我们全都在直奔天堂,我们全都在直奔相反的方向.
