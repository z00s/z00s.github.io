The book I recommended today named The Ordinary World. It was a river novel written by a famous Chinese writer, Lu Yao.
Actually, my Chinese teacher recommended me to read this book many years ago, when I was a high school freshman.
Many years past and the story have been adapted for a television series, but I still never read that book.

Since my Chinese teacher’s recommended, I’m pretty interested with this TV series. So I try to catch up.
It attracted me since the first scene. After few days, I regret it.
I regret that I didn’t read that book when I was 16 years old. And the hero, Sun Shaoping is a high school student
just like my age when I heard this book. I didn’t read the book but I watch TV series, it described how ordinary people
struggled for a better life in the 1970s to 1980s.

I think it’s a good TV products. But when I do some research about this book on the internet.
A lot of netizens think that this TV series is not excellent enough compared to the original novel.
As the writer Lu Yao was a native in northwest country, he had a kind of unique understanding of the country life and the special relationship among the peasants.
You can read that between the lines. He had ever been a temporary teacher, which was similar to the character in his book.
Elderly people think that we young people cannot understand what happened in that time.
The Cultural Revolution and household contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output.
You can feel these thing’s influence on one generation. So I prepare to read the original novel, and recommend it to all of you.

To describe that time, appropriate or not, a passage from A Tale of two Cities came to me, I can’t recite it, here it is:

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness,
it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness,
it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us,
we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way.
