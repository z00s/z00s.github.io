I'll talk about the differences between China and US

Frankly speaking, I have no clue about this topic. Because I've never go aboard, for bussiness or a trip.

That means the things I'll talk about today are not from what I saw, but somtehing I heard from foreigners I met before. 

I attend a selective course named British and American social culture. The teacher is a elderly woman come from America.
She is very fat, like a ball, she show us a photograph with her husband. Two balls.
So I think thats the first difference. American is fatter than Chinese, I think.
The amazing thing is even she's fata like that, but she was tag-dancing on the platform at the first class. 
Acttual I little worry about the platform that time.
