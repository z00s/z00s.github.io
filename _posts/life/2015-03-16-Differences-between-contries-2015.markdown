I'll talk about the differences between China and US

Frankly speaking, I have no clue about this topic. Because I've never go aboard, for bussiness or a trip.

That means the things I'll talk about today are not from what I saw, but somtehing I heard from foreigners I met before. 

I attend a selective course named British and American social culture. The teacher is a elderly woman come from America.
She is very fat, like a ball, she show us a photograph she took with her husband. Two balls.
So I think thats the first difference. American is fatter than Chinese, I think.
The amazing thing is event she's fat like that, but she was tag-dancing on the platform at the first class. 
Actually I was a little worried about the platform that time.

when we speak of obesity problem, we can talk about the food. Most of American food come from another country. The steak, 
as an example, they often like medium well, means 70% cooked. And she share cookies she made with us.

the most different thing is two country's people have different value in thier education, the way thinking....
